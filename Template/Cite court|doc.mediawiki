==Description of fields==
''All fields are optional!''
; litigants : List of litigants, such as "Miranda v. Arizona"; also known as the title of the case.  If a Wikipedia article using this exact string exists, a link will automatically be created.  Alternately, if an article exists but another name is desired for display, a wikilink may be specified; i.e., "<nowiki>[[Case article|This v. That]]</nowiki>".  Note: This parameter should likely not be optional. This presently cannot be specified as ''title'', which is inconsistent with other citation templates.
; reporter : The abbreviated term for whatever [[Reporter (law)|reporter]] is being referenced; i.e., "U.S." for the U.S. Supreme Court's "[[United States Reports]]". '''Important:''' "reporter" in this context means an official law publication, not a journalist.  This presently cannot be specified as ''work'', which is inconsistent with other citation templates. Do not wikilink.
; vol : Volume of the reporter. Only used for US case citations (and those given in the same format); otherwise, just include the information as part of ''reporter'' in the format given by the source. This presently cannot be specified as ''volume'', which is inconsistent with other citation templates.
; opinion : The opinion number, often the number of the first page of the case. Only used for US case citations (and those given in the same format); otherwise, just include the information as part of ''reporter'' in the format given by the source.
; [[Case citation#Pinpoint citations|pinpoint]] : Identifies a specific part of a decision, typically by page or paragraph number. This presently cannot be specified as ''at'', ''page'', or ''pages'', which is inconsistent with other citation templates.
; court : The name or (optionally) standard abbreviation for the court being cited (e.g. "[[3d Cir.]]" or "[[M.D. Ala.]]" or "[[Allahabad High Courtâ€Ž]], India"). If the abbreviated form would be a red link, use the long one (even if it is also a red link for now). See [https://web.archive.org/web/20171118125409/http://www.alwd.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/pdf/CM2_Appendix4.pdf here] for a list of courts in the United States. In order for ''court'' to appear, ''date'' must also be specified.  Note: This parameter also should likely not be optional.
; date : The year or full date in which the court rendered its decision. Note: This parameter also should likely not be optional, or the ''court'' parameter will break.
; url : A Web address for the court document(s).  For example, for a [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case, the [[URL]] to ''[[FindLaw]]'' is <code><nowiki>http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol={{{vol}}}&page={{{page}}}</nowiki></code>. It may be permissible to use the URL of a Web page that provides summary information about the case, if the case documents are not available;  however, an article about the case should be cited with {{tl|Cite web}} or {{tl|Cite news}}.  {{em|This}} template is for citing a legal document and its wording directly.
; access-date or accessdate : The date that you viewed the URL, not the date of the case.  This presently is not displayed, which is inconsistent with other citation templates.
; via : Name of the website (republisher) if the URL does not go to the site of the ''reporter'' above. This presently is not displayed, which is inconsistent with other citation templates.
; lang : Two-letter [[ISO 639-1]] language code for the language in which the document is written, {{em|if}} it is not English (leave this parameter out if it is). This presently is not displayed, which is inconsistent with other citation templates.
; archive-url or archiveurl : URL to a backup copy of the document at Wayback.Archive.org or some other archival site.  This presently is not displayed, which is inconsistent with other citation templates.
; archive-date or archivedate : Date of the above archival. This presently is not displayed, which is inconsistent with other citation templates.
; url-status : ''live'' if the original URL no longer works; ''dead'' or blank otherwise; controls what is done with the ''archive-url''. This presently is not functional, which is inconsistent with other citation templates.
